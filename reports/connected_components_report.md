## Interpretation of Connected Components

Connected components represent clusters of fields that are directly or indirectly linked — that is, they frequently co-occur in the same sections of the JSON structure.


- **Number of Components:** 6
- **Largest Component Size:** 12
- **Average Component Size:** 7.33


_Interpretation:_

- A **small number of large components** suggests that many fields are interrelated, indicating a cohesive JSON schema.

- A **large number of small components** implies that some parts of the data are isolated or used in specialized contexts.

- The **largest component** can be viewed as the 'core schema' — the main structure tying most fields together.
